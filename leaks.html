                    <strong>Context:</strong>  Memory management related exceptions constitute a
                    major portion of fault triggers in deep learning. Memory leaks
                    and OOM (out of memory) errors may during the training, loading
                    of data, writing/saving of data and also during the inferencing
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    <strong>Problem:</strong>  When a program terminates due to OOM errors during
                    the process of training the network, in absence of a checkpoint, the
                    knowledge gained during the training process is lost. Due to this,
                    the computational energy spent on the training is wasted.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> 
                    Factor in the memory availability constraints and possible 
                    OOM exceptions while designing the program to train the
                    network and take appropriate steps to avoid them. This may reduce
                    the chances of OOM errors and prevent the corresponding waste
                    of energy.

                    <strong>Example:</strong> An example of this pattern can be seen in 
                    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42886049/">this</a> stack overflow post .The user runs into out of memory
                    error while training a Keras sequential model due to the inefficient
                    management of the memory in a program that uses a for loop caus-
                    ing a waste of energy spent on the training. This could be avoided
                    by defining the network outside the for loop and reusing the same
                    instance every iteration as suggested in the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/42933345">answer</a>.
