                    <strong>Context:</strong>  Working with deep learning models require reading and
                    writing enormous amounts of data during data cleaning, data preparation, 
                    and inferencing stages of the deep learning workflow.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    <strong>Problem:</strong>  Read and write operations have an influence on the 
                    energy consumption of a processor. Due to the size of data
                    involved in deep learning, not performing them efficiently may
                    lead to increased machine cycles, unnecessary data movements and
                    increased memory footprint leading to increased energy consumption.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> While reading and writing the data, take care to minimize
                    the number of operations using efficient implementation methods.
                    Avoid non essential referencing of data to reduce the memory footprint.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    <strong>Example:</strong>   Suppose a user wants to load a large number of images
                    in batches to train a model in tensorflow. Loading these images in
                    the RAM before the training requires a lot of memory to hold the
                    images increasing the memory footprint. Instead, the user could
                    use map function from tf.data.Dataset to have only the path to the
                    images and load the batch of images only during the train step.
                    Loading the data this way minimizes the memory usage required to hold all the data in the RAM.
