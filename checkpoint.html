                    <strong>Context:</strong> The training duration of some deep learning models can
                    be very long, ranging from several hours to several months even with the use of 
                    powerful hardware. This would require the training hardware running for a 
                    long duration without any breakdown. Failure in hardware, interruption in the power 
                    supply, or errors in the software may cause termination of the training process before it completes.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    <strong>Problem:</strong> Incomplete training due to termination of the process
                    leads to the loss of knowledge gained during the training. This would render the 
                    energy spent on the training process useless. Subsequent retraining would require 
                    the process to start from scratch.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> Checkpointing is a fault tolerance technique used in long
                    processes. In neural networks, checkpointing lets the users save the
                    intermediate model state generated during the training process. In case of a failure, 
                    the users can resume the training process from the latest checkpoint instead of restarting from scratch. 
                    While checkpointing at regular intervals may come with a few overheads of its
                    own, it can help save energy wastage caused by termination
                    of long training process due to faults.

                <p class="card-text">
                    <strong>Example:</strong> Consider a model that requires several hours of training
                    on a preemptible instance to get decent results. Since the preemption may occur in the middle of the training, not having a check-
                    point would lead to the loss of knowledge gained during the process
                    since the training cannot be resumed from the point of preemption.
                    Having checkpoints would preserve the state of the model at regular intervals and the training could be resumed from the latest
                    checkpoint in the case of a preemption. This would save the energy wastage caused by loss of knowledge due to the interruption in the
                    training. The example is taken from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56414605/">this</a> Stack Overflow post.
