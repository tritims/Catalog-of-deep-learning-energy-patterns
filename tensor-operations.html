                    <strong>Context:</strong>  A tensor is a generalization of vectors and matrices in
                    higher dimensions. Tensors are a fundamental data structure used
                    in deep learning and are used to represent the input, output and
                    transformations. Thus tensor operations are performed very frequently 
                    in deep learning programs.

                <p class="card-text">
                    <strong>Problem:</strong>  Given the large number of operations that can be 
                    performed on tensors, the users may lack awareness about appropriate
                    library functions that can help them implement the operation and
                    go for custom implementations. These custom implementations
                    may not be the most efficient or optimized ones
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> 
                    Look for existing library functions or ways to combine
                    multiple library functions that can perform the given tensor operation. 
                    Library functions are often designed to perform the operations
                    more efficiently with optimized use of resources. Due to this, they
                    can be more energy efficient.

                    <strong>Example:</strong> Consider a case based on 
                    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67452064">this</a> post where the
                    user wants to multiply every element in a batch of tensors with
                    every other element, except for itself.  The user could write a custom
                    implementation as shown in the question of the post.  But this method
                    may not be optimized in terms of usage of memory and the number
                    of computations. A more energy efficient way instead would be use
                    combination of built-in Pytorch functions as shown in the 
                    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/67452307">answer</a>.
